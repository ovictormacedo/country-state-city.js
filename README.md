# country-state-city.js


This is an implementation of a Node based API to get countries, states and cities.

The database is almost a copy from this [project](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database). Since this is using PostgreSQL and not MySQL, during the conversion informations like column names are not guaranteed to be the same.
