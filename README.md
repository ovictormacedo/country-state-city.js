# country-state-city.js
This is an implementation of a Node based API to get countries, states and cities.

The database is almost a copy from this project https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database. Since this is using PostgreSQL and not MySQL, during the convertion informations like column names are not guaranteeded to be the same.
